# DOM
- Document Object Model 
  - Object oriented related
  - Only one DOM in the HTML page
  - If there is an iframe tag then it has its own DOM
  - Communication between iframe DOM and main DOM is possible but they are independent.
  - window.document === document is true

# NOTES

- return very first element find with id

- HTMLCollection object looks like Array but it is not Array
- HTMLCollection has length property so the we can iterate over the values

## document.getElementsByClassName('navigation')
- return multiple DOM element as HTMLCollection object
- HTMLCollection object looks like Array but it is not Array
- HTMLCollection has length property so the we can iterate over the values
